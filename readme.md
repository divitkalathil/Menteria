# HackVerse21
Hackathon organized by NIT Surathkal

Title : Menteria

Description
Our hack is an android application based on one to one guidance for competitive coding. A person can register himself on our app and give us the input about himself and code force ratings. According his ratings, he can be a mentor or mentee. We have set threshold ratings after which person can become Mentor. One mentor can be assigned to many mentee but one mentee cannot have more than one mentor. This will allow user to communicate with his mentor who is using same competitive platform (for now limited to codeforce) and solve his doubts, discuss his Algorithm and code and seek guidance. This is one of the unique application as such platform is not available till now.
